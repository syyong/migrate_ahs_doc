1. input file: res_manager.csv [1]
* need instructions on how to prepare the csv file [5]*
2. configuration files:
  i. cd drupal/modules
  ii. mkdir -p config/install
  iii. create a migration info file. For example, migrate_ahs_teaching.info.yml [2].
  iv. create a migration group setting file. For example, migrate.migration_group.Teachings.yml [3].
      -- you only need this once. For the rest of the migrations, if they belong to the same group, you can omit this.
  v. cd config/install
  vi. create a migration yaml(yml) file. For example, migrate.migration.email_teachings.yml [4].
3. run the migration [6]
  i. the drupal directory
  ii. drush en <module name>. For example. drush en migrate_ahs_teaching -y
  iii. drush mi <migration id>. For example, drush mi email_teachings. It should tell you how many items have been processed.
  iv. Check the content if they have been loaded at the drupal site.
4. You can check the migration process by typing: drush ms <migration id>
5. If you need to update the migration yaml file after you have enabled the module, you can do it at the drupal site:
  i. navigate to the Single import page:
<url to the drupal site>/admin/config/development/configuration/single/export
  ii. select export and look for your configuration file. Pick 'migration' for Configuration type and pick the name of your migration. In this example, it's Email teachings.
  iii. copy the configuration and navigate to 
<url to the drupal site>/admin/config/development/configuration/single/import
  iv. Select the migration configuration type again and paste the configuration into the box.
  v. Click import at the bottom of the page to save it.
