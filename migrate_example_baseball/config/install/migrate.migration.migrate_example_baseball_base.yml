# This is a template for baseball box score migration - this will be turned into
# multiple "real" migrations, each with a distinct path for a specific CSV file.
id: migrate_example_baseball_base
label: Baseball box scores
source:
  # The source data is in CSV files, so we use the 'csv' source plugin.
  plugin: csv
  # @todo: Remove when we have templates and don't need to put a value here.
  path: temp.txt
  # At install time, for each available source file this template is loaded, the
  # specific file set as source.path, and the migration saved with a unique
  # id.
  # path: public://migrate_example_baseball/GL20*.txt
  # These next four lines are actually being set to their default values here
  # and can be omitted.
  delimiter: ,          # The field separator of the source file.
  enclosure: '"'        # Character used to enclose values in the source.
  escape: "\\"          # Escape character within values in the source.
  header_row_count: 0   # The number of rows at the beginning which are not data.
  # These are the field names from the source file representing the key
  # uniquely identifying each game - they will be stored in the migration
  # map table as columns sourceid1, sourceid2, and sourceid3.
  identifiers:
    - start_date
    - home_team
    - home_game_number
  # Here we identify the columns of interest in the source file. Each numeric
  # key is the 0-based index of the column. For each column, the key below
  # (e.g., "start_date") is the field name assigned to the data on import, to
  # be used in field mappings below. The value is a user-friendly string for
  # display by the migration UI.
  column_names:
    # So, here we're saying that the first field (index 0) on each line will
    # be stored in the start_date field in the Row object during migration, and
    # that name can be used to map the value below. "Date of game" will appear
    # in the UI to describe this field.
